# sort_alg
BUBBLE SORT && QUICK SORT (RECURSIVE, THE PIVOT is LAST)
My first project for university!
It's testing/comparison the 2 algoriths of sorting: BUBBLE SORT and QUICK SORT.
Can process command-line arguments:

==========================HELP==========================
1. -t       show execution time of sorting algorithms
2. -o       activate testing sorts
3. -s       show numbers of swaps and comparisons
4. -a       original and sorted array
5. -N <num> creating a random array of <num> (no more than 4095) elements and sorting\
========================================================
