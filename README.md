# sort_alg
BUBBLE SORT && QUICK SORT (RECURSIVE, THE PIVOT is LAST)
My first project for university!
It's testing/comparison the 2 algoriths of sorting: BUBBLE SORT and QUICK SORT.
Can process command-line arguments:

==========================HELP==========================
* -t       show execution time of sorting algorithms
* -o       activate testing sorts.
* -s       show numbers of swaps and comparisons.
* -a       original and sorted array.
* -N <num> creating a random array of <num> (no more than 4095) elements and sorting.
========================================================
